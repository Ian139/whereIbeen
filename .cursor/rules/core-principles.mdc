# Core Development Principles

## 1. Code Simplicity and Clarity
- Write simple, readable code that's easy to understand and maintain
- Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering
- Follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Use clear, descriptive naming for variables, functions, and classes

## 2. Safety First Approach
- Never generate code without understanding the full context
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Verify dependencies and versions before suggesting them
- Handle errors and edge cases appropriately

## 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic, working implementations before adding complexity
- Build features incrementally, ensuring each step works
- Test core functionality before adding advanced features
- Document assumptions and limitations clearly
