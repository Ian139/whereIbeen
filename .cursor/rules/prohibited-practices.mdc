# Prohibited Practices

## DO NOT
- Generate code without understanding context
- Implement overly complex solutions
- Skip error handling
- Use deprecated APIs
- Ignore security best practices
- Make assumptions about requirements

## When to Seek Clarification
Always ask for clarification when:
1. Requirements are unclear
2. Multiple implementation options exist
3. Security concerns arise
4. Performance implications are unclear
5. Integration points are ambiguous

Remember: It's better to ask questions first than to implement incorrect or unsafe solutions.
