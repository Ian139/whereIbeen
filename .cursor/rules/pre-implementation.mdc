# Before Writing Code

## Pre-Implementation Checklist
1. Understand the complete requirement
2. Verify all necessary dependencies are available
3. Check for existing similar implementations
4. Consider potential edge cases
5. Plan error handling strategy

## When to Ask Questions
- When requirements are ambiguous
- Before implementing complex features
- When dealing with security-sensitive operations
- If multiple implementation approaches exist
- When external dependencies are needed
